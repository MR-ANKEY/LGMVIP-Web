# LGMVIP-Web

***This repository is to share my workings as a Web Developing Intern in the Virtual Internship Program (VIP) at [LetsGrowMore](https://letsgrowmore.in/vip/) which is held in September 2022.***

***I would like to thank [Aman Kesarwani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/~amankesarwani/) Sir and the team of [LetsGrowMore](https://letsgrowmore.in/vip/) Community for giving me this opportunity to enhance my skills and work on such an amazing projects.***

During this Web Development Internship we were having 3 levels of tasks, out of which we needed to complete at least 2 or more for the Internship completion & certification from [LetsGrowMore](https://letsgrowmore.in/vip/).

## [Task-1/ToDo-List](https://todo-list-mr-ankey.vercel.app/)

Develop a basic to-do list that enables a user to add daily tasks.
The to-do list web app must allow users to add new items to a list, and items added to a list must be visible. Also, a user can mark a task “complete” upon its successful completion, and these completed tasks must appear on a separate list, say Completed Tasks.
You can also add a separate section titled Pending Tasks that will list all the tasks that require completion. In such a case, the to-do list will be a union of the Pending Tasks list and the Completed Tasks list. Irrespective of the list, a user must be able to delete or edit tasks from it.
To further increase the web app's complexity or make it more detailed, you can add the date and time when a task is added and/or completed.

## [Task-2/React-App](https://get-users-app.vercel.app/)

In Task 2, there is single page Web Application made using ReactJS and basics of Web Development. This project fetches information of employees of the company by API calling. Pure custom CSS was used to design the application. It also have a feature i.e. a API loader made through customized CSS, which spins till API calling is completed.
